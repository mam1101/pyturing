## (Py)turing

(Py)turing is a programming language for simulating Turing Machines using a Python based interpreter.

Updates:
1.0 (5/3/2018)
  - Formally released repository; Added a basic interpreter built in Python which processes finite tape Turing Machines.
1.1 (5/13/2018)
- Added documentation and more formal syntax checking for the general Unicode interpreter. Started work on the compiled version.

Roadmap:
  - Build a compiler for (Py)turing in C
  - Make current interpreter more efficient
  - Build a debugger/improved syntax checker
  - Allow for register storage and tape writing
  - Command line interface for dynamic, non compiled (Py)turing code

Turing's "Thesis":
From "On Computable Numbers": It is possible to create a single computing machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence.
