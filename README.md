##(Py)turing

(Py)turing is a programming language for simulating Turing Machines using a Python based interpreter.

Updates:
1.0 (5/3/2018)
  - Formally released repository; Added a basic interpreter built in Python which processes finite tape Turing Machines.

Roadmap:
  - Build a compiler for (Py)turing in C
  - Make current interpreter more efficient
  - Build a debugger/improved syntax checker
  - Allow for register storage and tape writing
  - Command line interface for dynamic, non compiled (Py)turing code
